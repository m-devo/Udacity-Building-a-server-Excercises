To Complete This Exercise:

    Install Node modules. Note: if you complete the project in the provided workspace, you can skip this step because it has already been completed

    npm install

    Install express

    npm i express

    Install type definitions for express

    npm i --save-dev @types/express

    Install nodemon

    npm i --save-dev nodemon

    Add a start script for nodemon in the package.json file

    "start": "nodemon src/index.ts"

    Import express into index.ts

    import express from 'express';

    Create your application object with express()

    const app = express();

    Set a port

    const port = 3000;

    Add an API endpoint to get a route, then send a response to the browser

    app.get('/api', (req, res) => {
     res.send('Hello, world!');
    });

    Set your application to listen on your port and output a message to the console with app.listen

    app.listen(port, ()=> {
     console.log(`server started at localhost:${port}`)
    });

    Run npm run start to see the application start in development mode.
    Run npm run build and node build/. to build and run your file project.
